# 🚀 AWS Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my cloud lab — this is where I document and ship real-world AWS projects as part of my DevOps journey.  
Each project in here tackles a different challenge — think migrations, auto-scaling setups, DNS wizardry, storage architecture, and the occasional infrastructure meltdown 😅.

This isn’t your average repo. Everything here is:

- **Hands-on**
- **Production-minded**
- **100% Infrastructure-as-Code wherever possible**

---

## 💡 What’s Inside?

Here you'll find:

- 🏗️ **Lift-and-Shift Migrations** — moving legacy workloads to AWS the smart way  
- 🔁 **Auto Scaling Setups** — self-healing, elastic infra using EC2 + ALB  
- 📦 **S3 Storage Workflows** — for artifacts, media, and app-level backups  
- 🛰️ **Route 53 + GoDaddy DNS** — DNS management like a boss  
- 🔐 **IAM + Security Groups** — tight, clean, and role-based  
- 🧱 **Modular Infrastructure** — IAC where it makes sense (Terraform/CloudFormation coming soon)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech

- AWS EC2, S3, ELB, Route 53, IAM, Auto Scaling
- Linux, Bash scripts, GitHub Actions
- Occasional Vagrant/VirtualBox to simulate a hybrid infrastructure
- And yes — everything is terminal-first 🧑‍💻

## 🔍 Why This Repo?

I work on a wide range of tasks — from spinning up quick demos to rebuilding broken pipelines and reverse-engineering legacy systems.  
This repo keeps it all in one place — a living portfolio of what I’m building, breaking, fixing, and automating in the cloud.
