This project demonstrates a full **Lift-and-Shift migration strategy** for a complex, multi-tier application stack from a local Vagrant-based environment to a scalable, production-grade infrastructure on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

By replicating and modernising the vProfile stack in the cloud, I implemented core DevOps and cloud engineering concepts, including:

- 🖥️ **EC2-based compute layers** for Tomcat, MySQL, RabbitMQ, and Memcached  
- 🔁 **Elastic Load Balancer (HTTPS + ACM)** for secure traffic routing  
- 📈 **Auto Scaling Groups** to handle dynamic workloads  
- 📦 **S3** for artifact storage and retrieval  
- 📡 **Route 53 Private DNS** for backend service discovery  
- 🔐 **IAM roles and security groups** for access control  
- 🚀 **Infrastructure-as-Code and automation** using user data scripts
